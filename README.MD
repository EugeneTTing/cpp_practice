# C++ Exam Practice

This repo contains solutions to C++ practice exam questions. Each practice question provided a `main.cpp` file for testing, a header file containing function declarations, and some pre-supplied functions in the corresponding `*.cpp` files. All other function definitions and Makefiles were my own work.

To run the programs, use `make` to create the binary. The results of each program are printed to the terminal when run.
